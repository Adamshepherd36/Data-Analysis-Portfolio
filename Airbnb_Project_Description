Project Overview
This project involved creating an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze real estate data, focusing on various metrics such as 
average price per bedroom, price by zipcode, and revenue over time. The primary objectives were to clean and prepare the data, perform data analysis, 
and create visualizations to present the findings effectively.



Key Tasks and Steps

Data Import and Preparation:
Imported the real estate data into Tableau.
Cleaned and transformed the data to ensure consistency and accuracy, handling missing values and correcting data types where necessary.

Data Analysis:
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
Analyzed key metrics such as average price per bedroom, price variations by zipcode, and revenue trends over the year.

Data Visualization:
Created various charts and graphs to visualize the data, including bar charts, maps, and line graphs.
Used Tableau's capabilities to create interactive visualizations that allow users to explore the data in detail.

Dashboard Creation:
Designed an interactive dashboard to display key metrics and visualizations.
Included filters and interactive elements to allow users to customize their view of the data, enhancing the interactivity and usability of the dashboard.

Key Metrics and Insights:
Avg Price Per Bedroom: Visualized the average price per bedroom to show how prices vary with the number of bedrooms.
Price Per Zipcode: Displayed a map and bar chart to show price variations across different zipcodes.
Revenue for Year: Created a line graph to show the revenue trend over the year, highlighting peak periods and overall growth.
Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings: Showed the distribution of listings by the number of bedrooms.



Insights from the Dashboard

The dashboard provided various insightful visualizations, such as:
Average Price Per Bedroom: Highlighted that prices increase significantly with the number of bedrooms.
Price Per Zipcode: Revealed geographical variations in real estate prices, with some zipcodes showing notably higher prices.
Revenue Trends: Illustrated the revenue trend over the year, showing seasonal variations and overall revenue growth.
Listing Distribution: Provided insights into the distribution of listings by the number of bedrooms, helping to understand market supply.



Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them

Data Cleaning:
Challenge: Ensuring data consistency and handling missing values.
Solution: Used Tableau's data preparation tools to clean and prepare the data, ensuring accuracy for analysis.

Complex Data Visualization:
Challenge: Choosing the right visualizations to effectively communicate insights.
Solution: Experimented with different types of charts and maps, focusing on clarity and usability to ensure the dashboard was informative and intuitive.

Interactive Elements:
Challenge: Making the dashboard interactive and user-friendly.
Solution: Incorporated filters and interactive elements to allow users to customize their view and explore the data in detail.



Lessons Learned
Importance of Data Cleaning: Proper data cleaning and preparation are crucial for accurate analysis and meaningful insights.
Power of Interactive Visualizations: Interactive dashboards enhance the understanding and communication of data insights.
Effective Use of Maps: Geographical visualizations provide valuable context for understanding price variations across different regions.

This project significantly improved my skills in data visualization and analysis using Tableau. It provided valuable experience in analyzing and 
presenting real estate data, helping to support decision-making and strategy development in the real estate market.
